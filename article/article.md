# Intro
### v.0.1

This is a **VEGETARIAN and GLUTENFREE Cookbook** for cyclingtravelers and other long-term travelers who dont like to cook.

When we embarked on our journey of cycling the world, I had little knowledge about cooking. In fact, neither my partner nor I were fan of spending time in the kitchen, and leaving our normie lifestyle behind was part of the appeal of this trip.

Both my partner and I follow a strict gluten-free diet[^1]. During our travels, we both became vegetarian. 
Our encounters with animals and witnessing the realities of large-scale meat production factories made consuming meat feel ethically wrong and groce. While everyone has their own preferences, please note that there won't be any recipes featuring products of dead animals.

No more dirty kitchen, you are going to cook on very different places with a lot of new challenges...

[^1]: Gluten-free, especialy wheat-free nuriture prevents us from having depressions!
